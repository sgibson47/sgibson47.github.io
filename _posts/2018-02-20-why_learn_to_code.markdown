This blog is a space for me to share my thoughts and experiences as I learn to code.  So I think explaining why I decided to undertake this challenge is a good place to start the blog.  I have a few reasons for learning software development.

To start, I needed new direction in my professional life.  For the past four years, I worked as a lawyer practicing environmental law.  The practice of law had its perks, but I wasn’t content.  A few years into working I found myself unsure of what goals I wanted to pursue and dispirited by just muddling through day to day.    

After a bit of mourning the life I had dreamed for myself as a lawyer, I set about searching for work that could fit my goals. I needed something that would stimulate my intellect while also providing me with access to well-paying jobs in different places.  I hoped for something that could one day give me flexibility in my schedule and perhaps even the option to work remotely as I traveled.  Lastly, I want a work environment where most of the people I interact with are my teammates with whom I can pursue shared objectives. After researching, having conversations with developers I knew and other folks that knew me best, I thought coding might be a good fit.  Once I spent time trying it out, I knew I was right.  

The primary reason I knew software development was a good choice for me has nothing to do with my list of desired traits in a career.  It’s that coding is rewarding! My first foray into development was building a Tic-Tac-Toe game.  I wanted to see if I had the capacity for this kind of work.  Parts of building the game were easy; others frustrated and confused me.  But completing each piece, especially the hard ones, boosted my confidence and reinforced that I could master the language I was working in.  Getting a test to pass was like solving a puzzle and getting an “A” on a quiz.  I got a little achievement buzz.  By the time I had a working game I was hooked.  

Not only is coding gratifying, but it also aligned with the goals I had for my professional life.  It challenged me intellectually.  It’s an in demand skill that will help me access work across the globe.  Among those many opportunities for work coding, I could find a supportive team to work within.  After building up my skills and gaining experience in software development I might be able to set up a more flexible work schedule or even work remotely while traveling.  With the advent of boot camps and schools like Flatiron, I could pursue it without having to return to school for years.

I applied to Flatiron School’s Online Web Developer Program and haven’t looked back.
